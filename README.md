# PsycoSupport — Alpha Release
## 📖 Overview

**PsycoSupport** is an **alpha release** of a secure support application for early testers.  
It lets patients send private concerns to a psychologist and receive supportive advice.  
All communications are protected with **end-to-end encryption** during transit.

As part of this lab, you will step into the role of a **tester-cryptanalyst**:  
capture ciphertexts on the wire, apply **frequency analysis (Al-Kindi method)**, recover the keys, and decrypt the psychologist’s suggestions.  

> ⚠️ **Ethical note:** This is a **controlled educational exercise**. Do **not** use these techniques on real systems or networks outside the lab.
